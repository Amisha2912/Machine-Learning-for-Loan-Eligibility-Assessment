# Machine-Learning-for-Loan-Eligibility-Assessment
This project is dedicated to the implementation of a loan approval prediction system using Python. Through this endeavor, we aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the intricacies involved in building such a system.

## Key Project Phases:

<br>Data Cleaning: The project commenced with meticulous data cleaning to ensure the quality and integrity of our dataset.<br>
Data Analysis:We conducted comprehensive data analysis, exploring various features such as applicant income, credit scores, loan amounts, and more. This analysis provided valuable insights into the factors influencing loan approval decisions.<br>
Classification algorithms in machine learning: To build predictive models, we leveraged several machine learning algorithms, including:<br>
Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB): A probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem, which assumes that features are normally distributed.<br>
Decision Tree Classifier: This interpretable algorithm constructs a tree-like model to make decisions based on feature values, accommodating both categorical and numerical data.<br>
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier: A versatile non-parametric algorithm that assigns class labels based on the majority among its k-nearest neighbors. It's suitable for both classification and regression tasks.<br>
StandardScaler: We employed the StandardScaler preprocessing technique to standardize numerical features, improving the performance of select machine learning algorithms.<br>

## Conclusion
The choice of algorithm for testing and deployment was guided by their respective accuracies and performance metrics. The ultimate aim of this project is to develop a robust and efficient loan approval prediction system, empowering financial institutions to make data-driven decisions.
Among the classification algorithms in machine learning were employed in this project, Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB) emerged as the top performer, achieving the highest accuracy. This outcome underscores the potential of Naive Bayes in enhancing the predictive capabilities of our system.
